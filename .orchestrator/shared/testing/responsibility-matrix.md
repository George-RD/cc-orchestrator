```javascript
// QA Specialist owns these tests
describe('User Registration Flow E2E', () => {
  it('should complete full registration workflow', () => { /* ... */ });
  it('should work across all supported browsers', () => { /* ... */ });
});

describe('Performance Tests', () => {
  it('should handle 1000 concurrent users', () => { /* ... */ });
});
```

## Test Coordination Protocols

### Handoff Requirements

#### Backend → QA Handoff
```yaml
required_deliverables:
  - Unit test coverage report (minimum 85%)
  - Integration test results
  - API documentation with examples
  - Performance benchmark baselines
  - Security test points documentation
```

#### Frontend → QA Handoff
```yaml
required_deliverables:
  - Component test coverage report (minimum 80%)
  - Storybook component library
  - Browser compatibility matrix
  - Performance metrics baseline
  - Accessibility test results
```

#### QA → All Specialists Feedback
```yaml

  - Security vulnerability reports
  - Quality improvement recommendations
```

### QA Specialist

- Cross-system test coordination
- Test result aggregation and reporting

## Conflict Resolution

### Overlapping Test Coverage
When tests overlap between specialists:

1. **Identify the primary owner** based on the focus area
2. **Eliminate duplicate tests** in secondary areas
3. **Create shared test utilities** for common patterns
4. **Document the decision** in this matrix

### Test Failure Ownership
```yaml
unit_test_failures:
  owner: Implementation specialist (Backend/Frontend)
  escalation: QA Specialist if pattern detected

integration_test_failures:
  owner: Primary implementation specialist
  collaboration: Secondary specialist if cross-cutting

e2e_test_failures:
  owner: QA Specialist
  collaboration: Implementation specialists for fixes
```

## Quality Gates

### Code Review Gate
- Unit tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- Security tests must pass
- Performance tests must not regress

### Deployment Gate
- All integration tests pass
- E2E smoke tests pass
- Security scans complete
- Performance benchmarks met

### Release Gate
- Full test suite passes
- Cross-browser testing complete
- Performance testing complete
- Security testing complete
- Accessibility testing complete
