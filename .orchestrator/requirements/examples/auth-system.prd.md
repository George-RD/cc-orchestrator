## Problem Statement
Users need a secure way to create accounts, log in, and manage their sessions across our web application. Currently, we have no authentication system, limiting our ability to provide personalized experiences and secure user data.

## Solution Overview
Implement a JWT-based authentication system with secure password storage, session management, and user profile capabilities. The system will support email/password authentication with optional 2FA.

## User Stories
- As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password so that I can access personalized features
- As a returning user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my account
- As a security-conscious user, I want to enable 2FA so that my account is extra secure
- As a forgetful user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email and password
- [ ] Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds >= 10
- [ ] Users can log in and receive JWT tokens
- [ ] JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- [ ] Refresh tokens allow seamless re-authentication
- [ ] Password reset flow works via email
- [ ] Optional 2FA using TOTP
- [ ] All auth endpoints are rate-limited
- [ ] Session management allows users to see/revoke active sessions

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements
```yaml
endpoints:
  - method: POST
    path: /api/v1/auth/register
    description: Create new user account
    auth: none
    rate_limit: 5 per hour per IP
    validation:
      - email: required, valid email format
      - password: required, min 8 chars, complexity requirements
      
  - method: POST
    path: /api/v1/auth/login
    description: Authenticate user
    auth: none
    rate_limit: 10 per hour per IP
    validation:
      - email: required
      - password: required
      
  - method: POST
    path: /api/v1/auth/refresh
    description: Refresh access token
    auth: refresh_token
    
  - method: POST
    path: /api/v1/auth/logout
    description: Invalidate tokens
    auth: required
    
  - method: POST
    path: /api/v1/auth/reset-password
    description: Initiate password reset
    auth: none
    rate_limit: 3 per hour per email
```

### Frontend Requirements
```yaml
components:
  - name: LoginForm
    type: form
    features:
      - email/password inputs
      - client-side validation
      - loading states
      - error handling
      - remember me checkbox
      
  - name: RegisterForm
    type: form
    features:
      - email/password/confirm inputs
      - password strength indicator
      - terms acceptance
      - validation feedback
      
  - name: ProtectedRoute
    type: wrapper
    features:
      - automatic token refresh
      - redirect to login
      - loading states
```

### Data Model
```yaml
entities:
  - name: User
    fields:
      - id: uuid
      - email: string, unique
      - password_hash: string
      - created_at: timestamp
      - updated_at: timestamp
      - email_verified: boolean
      - two_factor_secret: string, optional
      
  - name: Session
    fields:
      - id: uuid
      - user_id: uuid, foreign key
      - refresh_token_hash: string
      - device_info: json
      - created_at: timestamp
      - expires_at: timestamp
      - revoked: boolean
```

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Auth endpoints respond in < 200ms
- Security: OWASP Authentication standards compliance
- Scalability: Support 100,000 active users
- Reliability: 99.99% uptime for auth services
- Compliance: GDPR-compliant data handling

## Dependencies
- Email service for password resets
- Redis for session storage
- bcrypt library for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken library for JWT handling

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Brute force attacks | High | Rate limiting, account lockout after failures |
| Token theft | High | Short expiry, refresh token rotation |
| Weak passwords | Medium | Enforce password complexity requirements |
| Email enumeration | Medium | Same response time for valid/invalid emails |

## Success Metrics
- User registration conversion rate > 60%
- Login success rate > 95%
- Password reset completion rate > 80%
- Zero security breaches

## Out of Scope
- Social login (OAuth)
- Biometric authentication
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Admin user management UI

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Basic auth (register/login/logout) - Week 1
- Phase 2: Password reset flow - Week 2
- Phase 3: 2FA implementation - Week 3
- Phase 4: Session management - Week 4

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should we implement email verification requirement?
- [ ] What should be the password complexity requirements?
- [ ] Should we log all authentication attempts for security monitoring?
