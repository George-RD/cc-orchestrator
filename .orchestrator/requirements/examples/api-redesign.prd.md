# Product Requirements Document: REST API v2 Redesign

## Document Metadata
```yaml
version: 1.0.0
status: active
last_updated: 2025-01-15
author: API Team
```

## Machine-Readable Configuration
```yaml
agents:
  - backend: required
  - frontend: optional
  - qa: required
  - docs: required
constraints:
  security_level: high
  performance_target: <50ms
  accessibility: N/A
  api_standards: ["REST", "JSON:API", "OpenAPI 3.0"]
complexity: medium
estimated_effort: 8
```

## Problem Statement
Our current API (v1) has inconsistent naming conventions, lacks proper versioning, doesn't follow REST best practices, and has no standardized error handling. This causes confusion for API consumers and increases integration time.

## Solution Overview
Design and implement API v2 following REST best practices, with consistent naming, proper HTTP status codes, standardized error responses, and comprehensive OpenAPI documentation.

## User Stories
- As an API consumer, I want consistent resource naming so that I can predict endpoint URLs
- As a developer, I want clear error messages so that I can debug issues quickly
- As a third-party integrator, I want comprehensive API docs so that I can build integrations without support
- As a mobile developer, I want efficient pagination so that I can build responsive apps

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints follow REST conventions (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- [ ] Consistent pluralized resource naming (/users, /posts, /comments)
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes for all responses
- [ ] Standardized error response format
- [ ] Pagination on all list endpoints
- [ ] Filtering and sorting capabilities
- [ ] API versioning in URL path (/api/v2/)
- [ ] Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- [ ] Request/response validation
- [ ] CORS properly configured

## Technical Requirements

### API Standards
```yaml
url_structure: /api/v2/{resource}/{id?}/{subresource?}
authentication: Bearer token (JWT)
content_type: application/json
rate_limiting: 
  - authenticated: 1000/hour
  - unauthenticated: 100/hour

pagination:
  style: cursor-based
  parameters:
    - limit: max 100
    - cursor: opaque string
  response_headers:
    - X-Total-Count
    - Link (rel=next,prev,first,last)

error_format:
  - error:
      code: string (e.g., "VALIDATION_ERROR")
      message: string (human-readable)
      details: object (field-specific errors)
      request_id: uuid
      timestamp: ISO8601
```

### Resource Endpoints
```yaml
resources:
  - name: users
    endpoints:
      - GET /users (list with pagination)
      - GET /users/{id} (single user)
      - POST /users (create)
      - PATCH /users/{id} (partial update)
      - DELETE /users/{id} (soft delete)
    filters:
      - status: active|inactive
      - created_after: date
      - created_before: date
    sorting:
      - created_at: asc|desc
      - name: asc|desc
      
  - name: posts
    endpoints:
      - GET /posts
      - GET /posts/{id}
      - POST /posts
      - PATCH /posts/{id}
      - DELETE /posts/{id}
      - GET /users/{id}/posts (user's posts)
    filters:
      - status: draft|published|archived
      - author_id: uuid
      - tag: string
```

### Response Formats
```yaml
single_resource:
  data:
    type: string (resource type)
    id: string
    attributes: object
    relationships: object (optional)
    links:
      self: url
      
collection:
  data: array of resources
  meta:
    total_count: integer
    page_info:
      has_next: boolean
      has_prev: boolean
  links:
    self: url
    next: url (if applicable)
    prev: url (if applicable)
```

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: 95th percentile response time < 50ms
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Backward compatibility: v1 remains operational during transition
- Documentation: Auto-generated from OpenAPI spec
- Monitoring: All endpoints tracked in APM

## Dependencies
- API Gateway for rate limiting
- OpenAPI tooling for documentation
- JSON Schema for validation
- APM solution for monitoring

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes for v1 clients | High | Maintain v1 for 12 months with deprecation notices |
| Migration complexity | Medium | Provide migration guide and tools |
| Performance regression | Medium | Comprehensive load testing before release |

## Success Metrics
- API adoption rate: 50% of clients on v2 within 6 months
- Developer satisfaction: >4/5 rating
- Support tickets: 50% reduction in API-related issues
- Integration time: 30% faster for new integrations

## Out of Scope
- GraphQL implementation
- Webhook system
- Batch operations
- WebSocket support

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core resources (users, posts) - Week 1-2
- Phase 2: Additional resources - Week 3
- Phase 3: Documentation and testing - Week 4
- Phase 4: Migration tools - Week 5

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should we implement field-level permissions?
- [ ] Do we need to support JSON:API includes for related resources?
- [ ] Should we version at the header level instead of URL?
