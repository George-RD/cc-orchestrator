I'll help you review the Claude code template repository. Let me start by exploring the repository structure and then examine the changelog and future-todo files.<analysis>
The Claude template repository represents an impressive simplification effort, reducing from ~3,958 lines to 716 lines (82% reduction) while adding sophisticated git worktree integration. The refactoring has successfully achieved its core goals of creating a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) architecture with clear separation of concerns.

**Strengths:**
- Clean architectural separation between orchestrator, specialists, and supporting systems
- Elegant confidence-based autonomy system with simple, actionable rules
- Shared coding ethos (38 lines) effectively eliminates redundancy across specialists
- Intelligent delegation patterns support both parallel and sequential workflows
- Git worktree integration enables enterprise-grade parallel development and session recovery

**Areas of Concern:**
1. **Git Workflow Complexity**: The git-workflow.md (140 lines) adds significant complexity that may not be necessary for all projects. This represents 20% of the total framework size.

2. **Task Template Bloat**: The task template has grown from simple to complex with git-specific fields (git_worktree, git_branch, commits, etc.), contradicting the simplification goal.

3. **Directory Structure Inconsistencies**: Multiple task folders exist (completed/, done/, active/, blocked/, archive/) suggesting incomplete cleanup from the refactoring.

4. **Specialist Redundancy**: While reduced, each specialist still contains similar structures for handoff format and git workflow instructions that could be further abstracted.

5. **Command System Overlap**: The orchestrate.md and status.md commands have overlapping functionality that could be consolidated.

<duplication_reduction>
1. **Specialist Git Instructions**: Each specialist contains identical git workflow instructions (6-8 lines per specialist). This should be moved to the shared coding ethos or handled by the orchestrator during delegation.

2. **Handoff Format Duplication**: The JSON handoff format is repeated in each specialist with minor variations. Create a single handoff template in shared resources.

3. **Task Directory Redundancy**: Consolidate completed/ and done/ directories into a single "completed/" directory. Remove unused archive/ directory if tasks are tracked in git.

4. **Command Logic Overlap**: The /orchestrate and /status commands share state detection logic. Extract common state detection into a shared function.

5. **Confidence Assessment Duplication**: Both confidence.yaml and specialists repeat confidence level definitions. Centralize in confidence.yaml only.

6. **PRD Template Redundancy**: The template exists in both template.prd.md and template/ directory. Remove the empty directory.

**Potential Additional Reduction**: ~80-100 lines could be eliminated through these consolidations, bringing the framework closer to the 600-line target while maintaining all functionality.

<todo_evaluation>
**High Merit Items:**
1. **File Structure Cleanup** - Critical need identified. Redundant folders and leftover artifacts confuse users.
2. **Template Validation Tool** - High value for ensuring MECE principles are maintained as templates evolve.
3. **Feature Lifecycle Management** - Essential for managing the archived vs active features systematically.
4. **Core vs Advanced Feature Balance** - The framework tier concept (minimal/standard/advanced) would help users choose appropriate complexity.
5. **Orchestration Logic Restoration** - The /orchestrate command worked well but lost the PRD-to-template conversion logic that was previously functional.
6. **TodoWrite Integration** - Claude's internal TodoWrite tool needs proper integration with the JSON task strategy to avoid dual state management conflicts.

**Medium Merit Items:**
1. **Interactive Tutorial System** - Valuable but could start with simple markdown guides.
2. **Community Examples Repository** - Good for adoption but not critical for functionality.
3. **Token Usage Analytics** - Useful for optimization but adds complexity.
4. **Plugin Marketplace** - Premature until core adoption is proven.

**Low Merit Items:**
1. **Video Documentation** - Text documentation is more maintainable and searchable.
2. **MCP Server Recommendations** - Too specific and rapidly changing.
3. **Automated Line Count Monitoring** - Over-engineering for a simple metric.
4. **Confidence Calibration ML** - Contradicts the "simple rules" philosophy.

**Items That Conflict with Simplification:**
- Advanced commands in .claude/commands/ (345 lines) - These should remain archived unless proven necessary
- Complex monitoring/metrics systems - These were correctly identified as aspirational
- GitHub Actions integration - Template-specific, not universal
</todo_evaluation>

<refactoring_issues>
1. **Git Integration Assumption**: The refactor assumes all projects need git worktree complexity, but many simple projects would work fine without it. This adds 140+ lines of complexity.

2. **Sequential vs Parallel Confusion**: The framework mixes two orchestration patterns (worktree-based parallel and main-branch sequential) which could confuse users about when to use which approach.

3. **Task JSON Growth**: The simple task structure has grown complex with git-specific fields, making it harder to understand and maintain.

4. **Lost Simplicity**: The original goal of <500 lines has been exceeded by 43% due to git integration, potentially alienating users who want true simplicity.

5. **Session Recovery Complexity**: While powerful, the session recovery mechanism requires understanding both git commits and task JSON state, increasing cognitive load.

6. **Specialist Assignment Rigidity**: The current structure assumes fixed specialist-to-worktree mapping, limiting flexibility for cross-functional work.

7. **Documentation Mismatch**: The README claims simplicity but the actual system now requires understanding git worktrees, a non-trivial concept for many users.

<recommendations>
1. **Create Framework Tiers**:
   - **Minimal** (400-500 lines): Core orchestration without git
   - **Standard** (600-700 lines): Add basic git integration
   - **Enterprise** (800-900 lines): Full worktree parallel development

2. **Restore Orchestration Logic**:
   - Rebuild the PRD-to-template conversion logic that was lost in refactoring
   - Ensure /orchestrate command maintains its simplicity while providing full functionality
   - Create clear mapping between PRD analysis and actionable task creation

2. **Modularize Git Workflow**:
   - Make git-workflow.md an optional plugin
   - Provide simple git-free alternative for basic projects
   - Allow users to opt-in to complexity as needed

3. **Consolidate Directory Structure**:
   - Remove redundant task directories (keep only active/, blocked/, completed/)
   - Clean up empty template directories
   - Move archived features to separate repository

4. **Simplify Task JSON**:
   - Create base task format (original 5-6 fields)
   - Make git fields optional extensions
   - Use composition over modification

5. **Abstract Specialist Patterns**:
   - Move all git instructions to orchestrator
   - Create single handoff format in shared resources
   - Reduce each specialist to 30-35 lines

6. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Create clear "Getting Started" for simple use case
   - Separate "Advanced Git Workflow" documentation
   - Add decision tree for choosing framework tier

7. **Versioning Strategy**:
   - Tag current version as "v2.0-enterprise"
   - Create "v2.0-minimal" branch with git features removed
   - Let users choose based on project needs

8. **TodoWrite Integration Strategy**:
   - Use TodoWrite for orchestrator internal planning (session-based, lightweight)
   - Use JSON tasks for specialist assignments (persistent, git-integrated)
   - Create bridge logic to optionally sync TodoWrite to JSON when needed
   - Maintain separation between orchestrator planning and specialist execution

9. **Focus on Core Value**:
   - Remember: "Elegant simplicity that works, not complex systems that might work"
   - Default to minimal, enhance progressively
   - Measure success by user adoption, not feature count
