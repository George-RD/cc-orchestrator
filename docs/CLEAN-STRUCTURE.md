# Clean Repository Structure Achieved! 

## What We Did

1. **Moved everything into `.cc-orchestrator/`** within project-template
   - Specialists, tasks, and framework files all organized
   - Clean separation from user's code

2. **Fixed all references** 
   - Commands now reference `/.cc-orchestrator/` paths
   - No external dependencies on root directories
   - Everything self-contained

3. **Removed duplicate directories**
   - No more `commands/`, `templates/`, `scripts/` in root
   - Everything lives in `project-template/`

## Final Structure

```

└── README.md                  # User guide
```

## Key Achievement

**project-template is now a complete, self-contained framework** that users can simply copy to their project:

```bash
cp -r project-template/* my-project/
cd my-project/
# Ready to use!
```

No setup scripts needed. No external references. Just copy and go!

## Benefits

1. **Clean separation**: Framework in `.cc-orchestrator/`, user code in `src/`
2. **Commands visible**: In `.claude/commands/` where Claude Code expects
3. **Self-contained**: All paths relative to project root
4. **No confusion**: One place to look for everything

The framework is now exactly as it will appear in a deployed project!
