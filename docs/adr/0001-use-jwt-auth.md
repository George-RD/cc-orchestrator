# Architecture Decision Record

## ADR-0001: Use JWT for Authentication

Date: 2025-01-15

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement authentication for our web application that will support both web and mobile clients. The authentication system needs to be:
- Stateless for better scalability
- Secure against common attacks
- Support token refresh without re-authentication
- Easy to implement across different client types
- Compatible with microservices architecture

## Decision
We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication with the following implementation:
- Access tokens with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh tokens with 7-day expiration stored in httpOnly cookies
- RS256 algorithm for token signing
- Token rotation on refresh
- Blacklist for revoked tokens

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Stateless authentication**: No need to store sessions server-side, improving scalability
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works seamlessly with web, mobile, and API clients
- **Microservices ready**: Each service can validate tokens independently
- **Performance**: No database lookup needed for token validation
- **Standard compliance**: JWT is an industry standard (RFC 7519)

### Negative
- **Token size**: JWTs are larger than session IDs, increasing bandwidth usage
- **Cannot revoke immediately**: Tokens remain valid until expiration unless using a blacklist
- **Complexity**: More complex than traditional session-based auth
- **Key management**: Need to securely manage and rotate signing keys

### Neutral
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand JWT best practices
- **Token storage**: Clients need secure storage mechanisms
- **Additional infrastructure**: Need Redis for token blacklist

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Session-based Authentication
- Description: Traditional server-side sessions with session IDs
- Pros: 
  - Simple to implement
  - Easy to revoke sessions
  - Smaller payload (just session ID)
- Cons: 
  - Requires session storage (Redis/Database)
  - Difficult to scale horizontally
  - Not ideal for microservices
- Reason for rejection: Doesn't align with our microservices architecture and scalability requirements

### Option 2: OAuth 2.0 with External Provider
- Description: Use OAuth 2.0 with providers like Auth0 or Okta
- Pros:
  - Battle-tested implementation
  - Advanced features out of the box
  - Reduced development time
- Cons:
  - Vendor lock-in
  - Additional costs
  - Less control over auth flow
  - External dependency
- Reason for rejection: Want to maintain full control and avoid external dependencies for core authentication

### Option 3: API Keys
- Description: Simple API key authentication
- Pros:
  - Very simple to implement
  - Low overhead
- Cons:
  - No built-in expiration
  - Difficult to manage permissions
  - Not suitable for user authentication
  - Less secure
- Reason for rejection: Insufficient for user authentication needs

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core JWT Implementation
- Implement JWT generation service
- Add token validation middleware
- Create refresh token endpoint
- Set up key rotation mechanism

### Phase 2: Security Enhancements
- Implement token blacklist with Redis
- Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement CSRF protection

### Phase 3: Client Integration
- Update web client to handle JWT flow
- Implement secure token storage
- Add automatic token refresh
- Handle token expiration gracefully

## Notes
- Consider implementing JWT introspection endpoint for token validation
- Monitor token sizes and optimize claims if needed
- Plan for migration strategy if moving away from JWT in future
- Ensure all team members are trained on JWT security best practices
