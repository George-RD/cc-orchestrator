# Final Repository Organization

## For Users: Super Simple

```bash
# Just copy the template to your project
cp -r project-template/* your-project/
cd your-project/

# You now have:
# - CLAUDE.md (orchestrator)
# - .claude/commands/ (custom commands)  
# - specialists/ (AI roles)
# - tasks/ (your work items)

# Start orchestrating!
/orchestrate
```

## What Each Directory Contains

### `project-template/` ⭐
**This is the complete framework as deployed**. It's a working example that shows exactly how your project will look. Users just copy this entire directory.

### `framework/`
The "source code" of the orchestration logic:
- Mermaid diagrams that define all behavior
- Headless mode specifications
- This is where you modify how orchestration works

### `templates/` + `commands/`
Source files that get assembled into `project-template/`. These are the individual pieces before they're put together.

### `scripts/`
Automation tools (like setup-project.sh). May be deprecated in favor of simple copying.

### `docs/`
All documentation including architecture and development history.

### `ARCHIVE/`
Old code from before refactor. Delete after 2 weeks of stable operation.

## Key Innovation

The entire framework deploys as just a few files in your project:
```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md              # 2.9K - Main orchestrator
├── .claude/commands/      # ~15K - Three commands  
├── specialists/           # ~3K - Four role files
└── tasks/*.json           # Your actual work
```

Total: ~21K of text files. No dependencies. No installation. Just copy and go.

## Understanding the Flow

1. **Development**: Edit `framework/*.mmd` → Update `commands/` → Test in `project-template/`
2. **Deployment**: Copy `project-template/` → Your project
3. **Usage**: Create tasks → Run `/orchestrate` → AI does the work

## Success Metrics Achieved

✅ < 300 lines of core logic
✅ Zero configuration required  
✅ Single directory to copy
✅ Commands visible in .claude/
✅ Clean separation of framework vs project
