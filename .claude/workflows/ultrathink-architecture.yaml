# Ultra-Think Workflow for Complex Architectural Decisions

name: Architecture Decision Analysis
description: Engage deep analysis mode for complex architectural decisions
trigger_phrases:
  - "architecture decision needed"
  - "complex design choice"
  - "need deep analysis"
  - "think harder about"

workflow:
  - step: gather_context
    actions:
      - analyze_current_architecture
      - identify_constraints
      - list_requirements
      - consider_future_needs
      
  - step: deep_analysis
    prompt: |
      Think harder about the architectural implications of this decision.
      Consider:
      - Long-term maintainability
      - Performance implications
      - Security considerations
      - Scalability requirements
      - Integration complexity
      - Team expertise required
      - Technical debt implications
      
  - step: generate_options
    actions:
      - create_multiple_approaches
      - evaluate_tradeoffs
      - estimate_effort
      - assess_risks
      
  - step: decision_matrix
    create:
      - comparison_table
      - pros_cons_list
      - risk_assessment
      - recommendation

example_usage: |
  "I need to make an architecture decision about our authentication system. 
  Should we build our own or use a third-party service? Think harder about 
  the implications for security, cost, and maintenance."
