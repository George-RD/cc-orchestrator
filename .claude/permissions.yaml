# Claude Code Permission Batching Configuration

# Batch operations that require the same permissions together
# This reduces the number of permission prompts during execution

batch_strategies:
  file_operations:
    # Group all file reads/writes in the same directory
    - group_by: directory
    - max_batch_size: 20
    - timeout: 30s
    
  git_operations:
    # Batch git commands together
    - group_by: repository
    - operations: [add, commit, push]
    - auto_batch: true
    
  test_execution:
    # Run all tests in a single permission request
    - group_by: test_suite
    - combine_coverage: true

permission_optimization:
  # Pre-request permissions for common workflows
  startup_permissions:
    - read: "**/*.md"
    - read: "**/*.json"
    - read: "**/*.yaml"
    
  # Cache permission grants for session
  cache_duration: 1h
  
  # Auto-approve patterns (still requires initial approval)
  auto_patterns:
    - "*.test.js"
    - "*.spec.ts"
    - "docs/**/*"

# Minimize permission requests during common workflows
workflow_presets:
  feature_development:
    permissions:
      - read: ["src/**", "tests/**"]
      - write: ["src/**", "tests/**"]
      - execute: ["npm test", "npm run lint"]
      
  documentation_update:
    permissions:
      - read: ["**/*.md", "docs/**"]
      - write: ["**/*.md", "docs/**"]
      
  refactoring:
    permissions:
      - read: ["src/**"]
      - write: ["src/**"]
      - execute: ["npm test"]
