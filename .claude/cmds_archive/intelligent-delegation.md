# Intelligent Delegation Logic

## Overview
The orchestrator analyzes task dependencies, blockers, and specialist types to determine optimal parallel/sequential execution patterns.

## Decision Matrix

### Dependency Analysis
```yaml
dependency_types:
  none: "Task can start immediately"
  technical: "Requires API/database/infrastructure first" 
  sequential: "Must wait for specific task completion"
  blocking: "Cannot proceed until blocker resolved"
```

### Specialist Coordination Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Full Parallel (Independent Tasks)
```
Conditions:
- No dependencies between tasks
- Different specialist domains
- No shared resources

Example:
├── Backend: User API endpoints (no deps)
├── Frontend: Login UI mockups (no deps)  
├── QA: Test plan design (no deps)
└── Docs: User story documentation (no deps)

Decision: Execute all 4 in parallel
```

#### Pattern 2: Staged Parallel (Dependency Chains)
```
Conditions:
- Some tasks depend on others
- Can group independent tasks
- Multiple parallel streams possible

Example:
Stage 1 (Parallel):
├── Backend: Database schema
└── DevOps: Infrastructure setup

Stage 2 (Parallel - after Stage 1):
├── Backend: API implementation (needs schema)
├── Frontend: UI components (needs infrastructure)
└── QA: Integration tests (needs API)

Decision: 2 stages, parallel within each stage
```

#### Pattern 3: Sequential Coordination (High Dependencies)
```
Conditions:
- Strong dependencies between tasks
- Infrastructure/security critical path
- Shared resource conflicts

Example:
1. DevOps: Setup CI/CD pipeline
2. Security: Configure authentication
3. Backend: Implement auth endpoints
4. Frontend: Integrate auth flow
5. QA: End-to-end auth testing

Decision: Sequential execution with handoffs
```

#### Pattern 4: Mixed Coordination (Complex Projects)
```
Conditions:
- Multiple independent features
- Some shared dependencies
- Different completion timelines

Example:
Parallel Stream A (User Management):
├── Backend: User CRUD APIs
├── Frontend: User management UI
└── QA: User workflow tests

Parallel Stream B (Analytics):
├── Backend: Analytics APIs
├── Frontend: Dashboard UI
└── Docs: Analytics guide

Sequential Coordination:
└── DevOps: Deploy both features
└── Security: Review both features

Decision: 2 parallel streams + sequential coordination
```

## Orchestrator Decision Algorithm

### Step 1: Task Analysis
```python
def analyze_tasks(task_list):
    return {
        "dependencies": extract_dependencies(task_list),
        "blockers": identify_blockers(task_list),
        "specialist_types": categorize_specialists(task_list),
        "shared_resources": find_conflicts(task_list)
    }
```

### Step 2: Pattern Recognition
```python
def determine_pattern(analysis):
    if no_dependencies and different_specialists:
        return "full_parallel"
    elif has_stages and parallel_within_stages:
        return "staged_parallel"  
    elif high_dependencies or infrastructure_critical:
        return "sequential"
    else:
        return "mixed_coordination"
```

### Step 3: Execution Planning
```python
def create_execution_plan(pattern, tasks):
    if pattern == "full_parallel":
        return delegate_all_parallel(tasks)
    elif pattern == "staged_parallel":
        return create_dependency_stages(tasks)
    elif pattern == "sequential":
        return create_sequential_chain(tasks)
    elif pattern == "mixed_coordination":
        return create_parallel_streams_with_coordination(tasks)
```

## Real-World Decision Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Feature
```
Tasks:
- Backend: Product API
- Frontend: Product catalog UI
- DevOps: CDN for product images
- QA: Product search tests
- Security: API security review

Analysis:
- Frontend depends on Backend API
- CDN setup is independent
- Security reviews API after completion
- QA tests API + UI integration

Decision: Staged Parallel
Stage 1: Backend API + DevOps CDN (parallel)
Stage 2: Frontend UI + QA tests (parallel, after Stage 1)
Stage 3: Security review (sequential, after Stage 2)
```

### Example 2: Authentication System
```
Tasks:
- DevOps: Auth infrastructure
- Security: Auth strategy design
- Backend: Auth implementation
- Frontend: Login/signup UI
- Docs: Auth documentation

Analysis:
- Everything depends on infrastructure + strategy
- Implementation must follow security design
- UI needs working backend
- Strong sequential dependencies

Decision: Sequential
1. DevOps + Security (parallel coordination)
2. Backend (after 1)
3. Frontend (after 2) + Docs (parallel with Frontend)
4. QA (after 3)
```

### Example 3: Multi-Feature Release
```
Tasks:
Feature A: User profiles (Backend + Frontend + QA)
Feature B: Notifications (Backend + Frontend + QA)  
Infrastructure: Database scaling (DevOps)
Security: Compliance audit (Security)

Analysis:
- Features A & B are independent
- Both need database scaling
- Security audit covers both
- Can parallelize feature development

Decision: Mixed Coordination
Parallel Stream A: User profiles team
Parallel Stream B: Notifications team
Sequential: DevOps scaling → parallel development → Security audit
```

## Implementation in Orchestrator

### Task JSON Enhancement
```json
{
  "id": "task-123",
  "dependencies": ["task-120", "task-121"],
  "blockers": ["infrastructure-setup"],
  "can_parallel_with": ["task-124", "task-125"],
  "coordination_type": "development|infrastructure|security",
  "execution_pattern": "parallel|sequential|staged"
}
```

### Orchestrator Decision Logic
```
1. Load all active tasks
2. Analyze dependencies and blockers
3. Group by coordination type and dependencies
4. Determine optimal execution pattern
5. Delegate accordingly:
   - Parallel: Multiple worktree assignments
   - Sequential: Single assignment with handoff
   - Staged: Batch assignments by stage
```

## Benefits

### Efficiency Gains
- **Maximum Parallelization**: When safe and productive
- **Proper Coordination**: When dependencies require it
- **Resource Optimization**: No conflicts or blocking

### Quality Improvements  
- **Dependency Respect**: No broken builds from missing dependencies
- **Proper Sequencing**: Infrastructure before development
- **Conflict Avoidance**: No simultaneous work on shared resources

### Intelligence Features
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Changes pattern based on current state
- **Blocker Detection**: Identifies and resolves bottlenecks
- **Optimal Throughput**: Balances speed with coordination needs
